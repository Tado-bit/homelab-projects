# Homelab Experience – CV Bullet Points

- Designed and implemented a multi-VLAN pfSense firewall lab simulating
  enterprise network segmentation and management plane isolation.

- Configured interface-based firewall rules and floating RFC1918 blocks
  to prevent lateral movement between Server, Security, and User networks.

- Hardened Server VLAN by restricting administrative SSH access to a
  dedicated Management subnet.

- Performed controlled red-team testing from Kali Linux to validate
  firewall behavior and identify attack paths.

- Implemented blue-team mitigations including GUI isolation, firewall
  logging, and rule optimization.

- Documented network architecture, firewall policies, and lessons learned
  using Git and GitHub for version control.

- Troubleshot DHCP, DNS, and routing issues using packet capture and
  Linux networking tools.

- Applied CompTIA Security+ aligned security practices in lab design.
