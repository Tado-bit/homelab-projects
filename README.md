# Homelab Projects – Networking & Cybersecurity

## Overview
This repository documents my hands-on homelab projects focused on
networking, security monitoring, and secure remote access.

These labs are built to reinforce real world concepts such as VLAN
segmentation, firewall policy design, log analysis, and remote access
security.

The emphasis is on practical implementation, troubleshooting, and
clear technical documentation.
