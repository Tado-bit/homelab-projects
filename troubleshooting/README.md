# Troubleshooting Labs

This directory contains hands-on troubleshooting labs performed in my homelab.
Each lab documents the problem statement, investigation method, packet or log
evidence, root cause, and resolution.

## Labs

- [DHCP Packet Capture Lab](dhcp-packet-capture.md)  
  Captured and analyzed the DHCP DORA process using pfSense packet capture
  to validate correct DHCP operation and firewall behavior.

More troubleshooting labs will be added as the environment grows.
